Tired of the same three cats? We've got commanders, blobs, and a dogo.

### Commander

[Download Super Mascot Commander](https://github.com/jacobguenther/chmod777s_beyond_all_reason_widgets/releases/download/initial/super_mascot_commander.zip)

Have your commander as your mascot. Type "/mascot comm". Your commander will be doing whatever it is that it is doing while also be doing that in the corner of your screen.

Enable Super Mascot GL4, DrawUnitCustom GL4, Super Mascot Commander in that order. You won't see your commander until the game actually starts.

### Simple

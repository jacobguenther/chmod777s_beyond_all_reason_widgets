## Stand Alone Widgets
### gui_advplayerlist_mascot_GL4

This is nearly the same as the in game mascots but it uses modern OpenGL for rendering and features a dog(no animation). It has one neat feature which is that it rains confetti when a decoy commander is destroyed.
Check the github [gist](https://gist.github.com/jacobguenther/5a28845de6c36600b433f894dcbf4e53) page for it or the discord [thread](https://discord.com/channels/549281623154229250/1128225032695459981/1128225032695459981) on it.
